Seoul is aiming to be more environmentally friendly when it comes to traversing the city. One major initiative is Ddareungi, also known as Seoulâ€™s bike sharing system. While it has been well received, it is clear that rental volumes vary and sometimes lead to wait times and shortages. It is important that we improve access now and meet future demand. 

With that said, we took a look to see what impacts bike rentals. More specifically the trends at different times (season, month, hour, etc.) and different atmospheric conditions. With the useful insights we can ensure, going forward, that anyone who wants to rent a bike will be able to. Thus, leading to less traffic, lower emissions, and an increase in overall physical health.
